== Season 1 ==


 What I hear when I'm being yelled at is people caring loudly at me.


 I don't want this parks department to build any parks because I don't believe in government. I think that all government is a waste of taxpayer money. My dream is to have the park system privatized and run entirely for profit by corporations, like Chuck E. Cheese. They have an impeccable business model. I would rather work for Chuck E. Cheese.


 Park, huh? Sounds like a really good idea.
 Great. Would you be willing to come to a town meeting and show your support?
 Absolutely. Now is this park gonna have a playground or maybe a pool for the kids?
 Oh, how old are your kids?
 No kids.
 Uh-oh.
 I'm gonna put him down as a "yes."
 Don't do that.
 Also, is the park gonna be at least a thousand feet from my house? Because, y'know, I really can't move again.
 April, please stand behind me.


 Hey park lady! You suck.
 Hear that? He called me park lady.


 The Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project was a great idea that just ran out of steam.  We had removed five cartoon penises - not even 10% - when we were shut down due to lack of funding.  To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises.  One penis in particular...


 you suck at Scrabble.
 I know.  You're destroying me.
 You're worse than my ex-wife and she's terrible at Scrabble. ''[looks at camera]'' And she's a bitch.
 Look out, man, I'm gonna get you one of these days.  I'm practicing.
 Yeah, I doubt that.  ''[looks at camera]'' Her name is Tammy Swanson and she's a serious bitch.


 When you're in government, there's a million ways to exploit your power.  Have I ever given into that temptation?  No.  Never.  I'm not that kind of politician.
:''[cut to Tom cutting in front of the line at a hot dog cart]''
 Official Parks and Rec business.  Just need to grab a quick hot dog.  ''[turns to girl behind him]'' Sorry about that, little girl.  You can get the next one.


 My idea of a perfect government is one guy who sits in a small room at a desk, and the only thing he's allowed to decide is who to nuke. The man is chosen based on some kind of IQ test, and maybe also a physical tournament, like a decathlon.  And women are brought to him, maybe...when he desires them.


 In a town as old as Pawnee, there's a lot of history in every acre.  This wooded area is the site of, um, the murder, actually, of Nathaniel Bixby Mark.  He was a pioneer who was killed by a tribe of Wamapoke Indians after he traded them a baby for what is now Indianapolis.  They cut his face off...and they made it into a dreamcatcher.  And they made his legs into rainsticks.  And that's the great thing about indians back then - they used every part of the pioneer.


 Am I the only ''[beep]''ing person here who doesn't know Jeanine Restrepo?


 The band has had a few different names over the years. When we started, we were Teddy Bear Suicide, but then we changed it to Mouse Rat.  Then we were God Hates Figs, Department of Homeland Obscurity, Flames for Flames, Muscle Confusion, Nothing Rhymes With Orange, then Everything Rhymes With Orange, Punch Face Champions, Rad Wagon, Puppy Pendulum, Possum Pendulum, Penis Pendulum, Handrail Suicide, Angel Snack, Just the Tip, Threeskin...  ''[long pause]'' Oh, Jet Black Pope.  We went back to Mouse Rat, and now we are Scarecrow Boat.  God, when I hear myself say Scarecrow Boat out loud I kinda hate it...


:''[Mark goes up to Ron]''
 Hey Parks Department.
 Hey Mark, this is Beth, my ex-wife Tammy's better looking sister.
 Nice to meet you.
 Nice to meet you.  You guys are together?
 Yep.  My ex-wife Tammy cheated on me, then we divorced, then last week I ran into her sister Beth here, turns out she hates Tammy too, so we started dating.  It's like a fairy tale.
 Tammy stinks.
:''[Mark goes up to Tom]''
 Brendanawicz!
 Hey Tom.
 Hey, I want you to meet my wife.
 Hi, I'm Wendy Haverford.
 ''[shocked because Wendy is attractive]'' Hi.  You're...Tom's wife?
 Don't hold it against me.
 Look at how hot she is!  Isn't that crazy?  And she's a surgeon!  She makes a ton of money!  BAM!
:''[Mark goes up to April]''
 This is Derek.
 Cool.  How long you guys been dating?
 We're just friends.  He's like the gayest person I've ever met, but I make out with him when I'm drunk sometimes.
 If you don't want to talk to me, you can just say so.
 I don't want to talk to you.

== Season 2 ==


 Do you think that marrying penguins made some kind of statement?
 Yes.  The statement was that you're very lonely and you need a pet.


 This is my boyfriend, Derek, and this is Derek's boyfriend, Ben.
 Hey.
 Hey...oh...wait, sorry.  What's the situation?
 What do you mean?
 How does this work?
 Derek is gay but he's straight for me, but he's gay for Ben, and Ben's really gay for Derek.  And I hate Ben.
 It's not that complicated.


Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]''.


 I like Ms. Knope.  I liked her.  I got to say when I first met her I didn't care much for her because like 99% of the people on any given day of my life she was very belligerent and disagreeable.  Ms. Knope was attractive to me.  As a man, I was attracted to her in her demeanor.  I was attracted to her in a sexual manner that was appropriate.  ...I don't want to talk about this anymore.



 I had to call in a few favors.  But if you don't call in favors to look at women in bikinis and assign them numerical grades, what the hell do you call in favors for?


 You know, in the 1880's, there were a few years that were pretty rough and tumble in Pawnee.  This depicts kind of a famous fight between Reverend Bradley and Annabeth Stevenson, a widowed mother of seven.  The original title of this was "A Lively Fisting."  But y'know, they had to change it for...obvious reasons.


 I was uh, dropping my niece off.
 What's your niece's name?
 Torpel. What?! I don't know. That's not a name. I don't have a niece... my niece's name is Stephanie?


 Hey, Mark, um, a little birdie told me that you have one unpaid parking ticket.
 That's funny, because a little birdie told me that your adoptive mother was arrested for marijuana possession.
 Oh snap!
 What?
 You didn't know that, huh?
 ...I didn't know I was adopted...


 What if he shows up with another woman?  What if one of my sleeves catches on fire and it spreads rapidly?  What if instead of Tic-Tacs I accidentally pop a couple of Ambien and I have to keep punching my leg to stay awake?
 Those are all insane hypotheticals and I promise you they won't happen.
 They have happened.  All of these have happened to me.
:''[cut to Leslie being interviewed]''
 Uh, no, there's more. One time I accidentally drank an entire bottle of vinegar. I thought it was terrible wine.  Once I went out with a guy who wore 3-D glasses the entire evening.  Oh, one time I rode in a sidecar on a guy's motorcycle, and the sidecar detached and went down a flight of stairs.  Another time I went to a really boring movie with a guy and while I was asleep he tried to pull out one of my teeth.  I literally woke up with his hand in my mouth.  We went out a couple times after that but then he got weird.



 I passed up a gay Halloween party to be here.  Do you know how much fun gay Halloween parties are?  Last year I saw three Jonas Brothers make out with three Robert Pattinsons.  It was amazing.


 Are you crying?
 I AM NOT CRYING, OK?  I'M ALLERGIC TO JERKS!


 Check this out. These are all the possible routes from Greg Pikitis' house to the statue.
 That looks like something you would find on the wall of a serial killer.
 In a way, that's a compliment. It shows dedication.



 I have never taken the high road.  But I tell other people to 'cause then there's more room for me on the low road.


 We didn't talk.  We made love.
 Oh my.  Mm.  Good.  Oh well, spare me the details.  I'm just happy—
 It was so intense, I didn't know where my flesh stopped and hers began. You know what I mean?
 Yeah...
 Our marriage was always a complete disaster, but we did have... that.  The two of us.  It's like doing peyote and sneezing slowly for six hours.
 This seems like a private matter, but I'm—
 That woman really knows her way around a penis.


 For my murinal, I was inspired by the death of my grandma—
 You said "murinal!"
:''[Everyone laughs]''
 No, I didn't.
 Yes, you did.  You said "murinal."  I heard it.
 Anyway, she—
 Jerry, why don't you put that murinal in the men's room so people can murinate all over it?
 Jerry, go to the doctor.  You might have a murinary tract infection.
:''[Jerry takes down his mural and walks away defeated]''
 ...Just wanted to show you my art...
 Murinal!  Murinal!  Murinal!
 Disqualified!
:''[cut to Jerry being interviewed]''
Pontillism|Pointillism]].  And each dot is a photo of the citizen of the town—
 ''[from other room]'' No one cares!  At all!


 we're playing it safe.


Chris Brown (entertainer)|Chris Brown]], how pissed off is he?


 I think this is gonna be a really good bonding experience with Ron. Guys love it when you can show them you're better than they are at something they love.

''(After Leslie falsely confesses to shooting Ron on the head, the Parks Ranger thinks it all has to do with her being a woman)''
 So, what happened? I mean, did you forget to check the entire field? I find a lot of women have problems with tunnel vision.
 No, I'm an excellent hunter.
 How did you end up shooting a guy in the head, then?
 Fair enough. I was walking in the woods and then I tripped and my gun went off.
 Ah, so you forgot to put the safety on.
 Oh, I always have the safety on, I mean... While I was tripping I saw a quail and I shot at it.
 In mid-trip?
 No. That's. Okay, fine. I got that tunnel vision that girls get. That's what happened, end of story.
 Well, I think you're hysterical because of all the excitement, obviously. So, I'm just not following your story. All right?
 ''[jumpcuts between statements]'' Um, I let my emotions get the best of me. 
:I just, I cared too much, I guess. 
:I was thinking with my lady-parts. 
:I was walking and I felt something icky. 
:I thought there was gonna be chocolate. 
:I don't even remember. 
:I'm wearing a new, um, bra and it closes in the front and it pop-open and it threw me off. 
:All I wanna do is have babies!. 
:Are you single? 
:I'm just, like, going through a thing right now. 
:I guess when my life is incomplete I wanna shoot someone. 
:This would not happen if I had a penis! 
:(While putting on lipstick) What? 
:Bitches be crazy. 
:I'm good at tolerating pain, I'm bad at math, and I'm stupid.


 There is a great dinosaur-themed restaurant in Patterson. It is called Jurassic Fork. I have gone there three times a week for the last 15 years.


 Now that you're getting divorced, I sort of feel like there may be some potential with me and Wendy.  Would it be okay with you if I asked her out once the fake dust settles?
 Yeah.  Why not?  Sure.
 Looking at her, I feel like she might be the perfect spooning size for me.  I'm gonna take a leak.


 This seems like none of our business.
 Be supportive, OK? Don't be all like, "No. I don't want to. I am a guy and I like fire, and playing hockey and eating meat. No, no says I."
 That was a really good Ron.
 Thank you.


 Well, based on that skit, I know you've heard about the new scandal that's about to break.  Who told you?  Was it the babysitter?  Was it the nurse who delivered our love child?
 What?
 Stop playing dumb.  You know damn well what happened.  I got the babysitter pregnant.  And when she was in the delivery room I had sex with not one, but four nurses in a supply closet...as well as a woman whose husband was getting a liver transplant. Hmm...Now which one of them told you?  Was it the liver lady?
 Wh...I...No one...I haven't...I haven't heard any of this.  Ever.  In my whole life.
 Oh!
 Believe me I would have remembered this.
 Okay.  Well, in that case, everything I just told you was just a funny prank.


 Got a call from some panicky morning joggers.  Apparently sanitation didn't empty this dumpster, to the raccoons delight.
 I thought raccoons were supposed to be nocturnal.
 Not in this town, sweetheart.  In this town, they're 24/7.  We can't have raccoons for the Christmas thing.  They'll hunt the kids for sport.


 What is your ideal man?
 He has the brains of George Clooney in the body of Joe Biden.


 Ronald, I've done it.  I've found your assistant and he's dope.  His name is Jean-Ralphio.  Jean-Ralphio!
 one, it is an absolute honor to meet you.  Two, who is that hot intern chick out there?  Because honestly, daaaaaaamn!
 Uh, take a seat.
 Right, here we go.
 So Jean-Ralphio...
 You got him right here.  Leave a message after the beep.
 Why do I want you as my assistant?
 For starters, access to the illest clubs.  And that's just for starters.  I will work for you.  I'll be on you 24/7.  I'll be like your family.  I'm here when you get here in the morning, sure enough, I'll be there tucking you into bed at night.  Don't worry, it's not gay.  Do we have questions?
 I think our only question is when can you start?
 Right now.  Let's do it.
 Thank you for coming in.  We will talk.
 Cool.  I feel good about this.  Hey, you know you can hit me up on Facebook anytime day or night, you know that right?
 Take care, buddy.
 Boom.
 So what do you think of your new assistant?
 I want to punch you in the face so bad right now.


Kurt Cobain|Kurt Cobain]] in 1994.


 Are these peppers for consuming?
:Culinary Teacher I wouldn't.  They're very hot.
 I'm gonna give it a try.  ''[eats a pepper]'' Mmm, hot.
 You're very brave.
This Is How We Do It|This Is How We Do It"]]]'' This is how you eat iiiit! ''[eats the pepper]''
 Don't do that, son.
:''[Tom chews, curses to himself, and runs from the table in pain]''


 Andy, I have a very interesting business proposal for you.  I'm moving a lot of heavy stuff out of my place this weekend...
 ''[immediately]'' Can I help you move?  I'm really good at it.  Afterwards I take the cardboard from the boxes and I use it for breakdancing.
 I'll go, too.
 Really?  'Cause an hour ago you told me you'd rather watch a sex tape of your grandparents.
:April Shut up.  I don't have anything else to do.  Do you want help or not?
 Alright.  See you guys later.
 I think that that's really, really sweet that your grandparents still make love.


 Leslie needs to butt out.  The whole point of this country is if you want to eat garbage, balloon up to 600 pounds, and die of a heart attack at 43, you can.  You are free to do so.  To me, that's beautiful.


 It's not just a job, gang.  We're gonna learn a lot from these seniors.  Some of them have been married for half a century.  And, no offense, but everybody here is terrible at love.  ''[points to Tom]'' Divorced, ''[points to April]'' dating a gay guy, ''[points to Ron]'' divorced twice, ''[points to Ann and Mark]'' jury's still out on you two, ''[points to Jerry]'' and Jerry, who knows.
 I've been happily married for 28 years.  You've met my wife Gayle many times.
 Whatever.


 Tommy, I just want you to know I'm so grateful for everything you did for me, but I only see us as friends.
 For now.  But think how much better our friendship would be if we added...doin' it.


 Come on Leslie, you know I'm not sexist.  I love powerful women.
 You do attend a shocking number of WNBA games.


 I dagger you on the dancefloor.  Just bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, now all the ladies sayin', bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce. What do you say, sexy?
 I'm out.
 Why?!
 I hate that guy.


 Let me explain something to you, Tweep. When you're in a situation, you don't have time to think.  So I thought to myself, "Don't think, Andy.  Act." 
 So you weren't thinking.
 Not at all.  I cannot emphasize enough how little I was thinking.


 What do you mean that Fairway Frank is not here?
 We're not sure that the possum we caught is, in fact, Fairway Frank.
 Leslie, whoever it is, it's a possum.  And the sooner it's dead, the sooner the mayor can do what he wants with it.
 ...Does he want to have sex with a dead possum?
 No!
 No.
 He's not a monster! He wants to stuff it and hang it above the urinal in his office bathroom so that little flecks of pee can get on it forever.
 Ew.


:''[Leslie, Tom, Jerry and Carl board a golf cart]''
 This thing is a mess.
 WE USED TO HAVE THREE CARS ACTUALLY.  THE FIRST ONE GOT PUSHED INTO THE CREEK BY SOME KIDS.  THE SECOND ONE RACCOONS GOT ONTO.  THERE WAS URINE EVERYWHERE.  AND THE THIRD ONE WAS RECENTLY STOLEN.
 What’s this one?
 THIS IS THE SECOND ONE.  THE RACCOON PISS ONE.


 Why didn’t you just tell everybody the truth?
 Are you kidding me? Imagine what Tom would have said.
:''[cut to Leslie impersonating Tom]''
 Damn, Jerry! You jumped in a creek for a burrito? What’d you do for a Klondike bar? Kill your wife?


 Clarence Carrington, David Moser, Michael Tansley, Ron Swanson.  Gathered together on a beautiful day in this beautiful park.  I think we should just take a moment and appreciate how lucky we are.
 I thought you were dead, Clarence.
 No, I'm going to outlive you and then I'm going to nail your wife.
 Screw you, you old coot.
 Classic David.  You're worse than Ron.
 Shut your damn mouth, Tansley.
 OK great, let's go!


 So if you had to sleep with one of the old guys, who'd it be?
 The super old one.
 Really?
 Mm-hm.  I'm an eyebrow girl.  I want to make out with him and chew his eyebrows off.


 So basically we're completely swamped.  All hands on deck.
 I don't even work in this building.
 Don't care. I need anyone with a pulse and a brain to pitch in.
 ''[walking in]'' Ron, do you need help with anything?
 No, we're good, thanks.  In fact, you can head home early.


 There's no way this ordinance goes through.  There's too much red tape.
 Mm.  This gridlock drives me nuts.
 Tell me about it.
 Yeah, I think you're gonna have to make an end run, y'know? Go right to the commissioner on this one.
 You know what?  I haven't thought of that.  That is a really great idea.
 Yeah?
 I'm gonna do that.
 OK. Your last resort is probably gonna be city council.
 Good luck there!
 My thoughts exactly!
:''[Cut to April being interviewed]''
 I have no idea what I was saying.


 Marchtember Oneteenth


 Every year, Pawnee Cares teams up with the local cable access station to raise money for diabetes research.  And it’s important because Pawnee is the fourth fattest town in the U.S. It goes us, Dallas, Tulsa and certain parts of the Mall of America.


 I am only here because I owe Leslie a thousand favors.  I'm not big on charities. Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Don’t teach a man to fish, and you feed yourself. He’s a grown man. Fishing’s not that hard.


 I've been doing some thinking. I'm not gonna ask Ann to move in with me.
 Why, is something wrong?
 No, I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
 ''[gasps]''
 I love her and I want a partner and....
 ''[interrupting]'' Horseback! You should ask her on horseback. No, you should ask her in a hot air balloon...No, she should be on a hot air balloon and you should ride up on horseback. Oh wait...she's in a balloon, you ride up on horseback, you point to the sky - up there, skywriting, "Marry me Ann."
 I think I can figure out the right way to ask her.
 How you ask someone to marry you is a very big deal. I mean, they have to repeat that story for the rest of their lives.
 So you think I should do it though?
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah definitely. Can you get five eagles? No, get ten eagles.
 Leslie...
 No, you're right, it's your life, get as many eagles as you want.


 I take care of my body above all else.  Diet, exercise, supplements, positive thinking.  Scientists believe that the first human being who will live 150 years has already been born.  I believe I am that human being.


 One time I waited outside a woman’s house for five days just to show her how serious I was about wanting to drill her.  Turns out, it was the wrong house.  She loved the story anyway.  We got to third base. Over the pants.


 Recently I had been thinking about maybe leaving this job but I felt like I needed a sign.  And then Ann broke up with me the week I was going to propose, the government got shut down, and yesterday one of those pigeons took a ''[bleep]'' on me.  And I was indoors.  So...


 I am an official member of a task force dedicated to slashing the city budget.  Just saying that gave me a semi.

== Season 3 ==


 for sport only, not for meat.  Fish meat is practically a vegetable.


 So are you happy to be back at work?
 Well, our budget has been slashed to zero.  I tried to buy fertilizer the other day for the soccer field.  Request denied.  We literally can't buy ''[bleep]''.


 Stop...POOPING.


 That was amazing. That was a flu ridden Michael Jordan at the '97 NBA finals. That was Kirk Gibson hobbling up to the plate and hitting a homer off of Dennis Eckersley. That was... that was Leslie Knope.


 I typed in your symptoms here and it says you might have... network connectivity problems.


 ''[flu ridden]'' It's not that I don't trust Ben, it's that I don't have faith in Ben. Also, I'm starting to forget who Ben is.


 I have a resting heart rate of 28 beats per minute. The doctors who studied me said that my heart could, literally, pump jet fuel up into a jet.


 My body is like a microchip. A grain of sand could destroy it! ''[exasperated]'' My body is a microchip...


 ''[delirious, to wall poster]'' Good evening everyone, I'm Leslie Monster and this is ''Nightline''.


 You had me at "Meat Tornado."


 First in Friendship, Fourth in Obesity."


 Oh, I love any book about vampires, werewolves, monsters, zombies, sorcerers, beasties, or time-traveling romances.  And if I had an hour alone with Robert Pattinson, he would forget all about Skinny Legs Magee, I’ll tell you that much.


 I know Tammy seems scary, but really she's just a manipulative, psychotic, library book pedaling, sex crazed she-demon.


 You're a joke.  You're not even a man anymore.  Oh, and by the way, last night I faked four out of the seven.
 So did I.


 Alright, switching gears here now, we got Leslie Knope and Tom Harver''fart'' and Ben Wyatt, and they're in the hizzy to talk about an upcoming event called the Harvest Festival.
 Well, The Douche, it's a Pawnee tradition, and it's where fun meets awesome...meets agriculture.  And it is gonna be next month right here in Pawnee and - spoiler alert - it's gonna have the best corn maze ever.
 You lost your virginity in a corn maze, didn't you Douche?
 Oh, that's right - to your mom!
:''[China Joe plays a sound effect of a woman moaning and going "Crazy Ira, clean your room!"]''
 There's also going to be hay rides.
 "Hey, ride me!" is what Crazy Ira's mom said.
:''[China Joe plays more moaning sounds]''
 China Joe, you are a poet!


 ''[reading Andy's "Thank You" note for her grandfather]'' "Dear April's grandmother."  I said grandfather.
 Oh, oops.  OK.
 "You are a beautiful and amazing woman."  Man.  "I hope someday I can become half the woman you are."  He's a man.  "Thank you for the $500."  It was five dollars.  "Enjoy the Mouse Rat CD."  He is deaf.
 OK, do you want me to make those changes or is it good?


 One time when I was in high school, a guy's mom called me and broke up with me for him. There was another time where I was on a date, and I tripped and broke my kneecap, and the guy said he wasn't "feeling it," so he left and I waited for an ambulance. One time I was dating this guy for a while, and then he got down on one knee and he begged me never to call him again.  One guy broke up with me while we were in the shower together.  Skywriting isn't always positive. Another time a guy invited me to a beautiful picnic with wine and flowers, and then when I tried to sit down, he said, "Don't eat anything.  Rebecca's coming."  And then he broke up with me.
:Ann Who's Rebecca?
 Exactly.


 Just give me all the bacon and eggs you have.  Wait, wait.  I'm worried what you just heard was, "Give me a lot of bacon and eggs."  What I said was, "Give me ''all'' the bacon and eggs you have".  Do you understand?


 There are two things I know about white people. They love Rachael Ray. And they are terrified of curses.


 Hey, I love you.
 Dude, shut up!  That is awesomesauce!


 I just want to get the work over as soon as possible so I can do some fishing.  Fishing relaxes me.  It's like yoga except I still get to kill something.


 I'm so desperate I even brought in my dream journal hoping it would inspire me.
ALF (TV series)|ALF]] and we're pretty happy."  That sounds nice.
 It was.


 Hey gang!
 Hey, what did you bring?
 I was in charge of the cake.  To be fair, it's not a cake so much as it is a vegetable loaf.  You got your mushrooms, your alfalfa sprouts, your spinach and I had it sweetened with fruit reduction.
 But did they ask you to bring a vegtable loaf or a cake?
 No, a cake, but this is so much healthier.
 So not only does this thing exist, but now you have deprived everyone of cake!
 Take a walk, Ron.


 Attention, everybody! Madams and...mis...wahs? If you would do me the obligation of having your honor, heretofore, in the room doth right over there, uh, hence.
 What?
 Big event, in that room, fifteen minutes.


 Who's to say what works. You know, you find somebody you like and you roll the dice. It's all anybody can do. 


 Jean-Ralphio.
 Can I throw something on you, see if it feels good?
 Sure.

 The key to burning an ex-wife effigy is to dip it in paraffin wax and then toss the flaming bottle of isopropyl alcohol ''from a safe distance''. Do not stand too close when you burn an ex-wife effigy.


 Fresh lettuce is my all-time favorite food.  What's your favorite food?
 Oh, I take Skittles and I put it between two Starbursts.  Know what I call it?
 Skittle Sandwich?
 ...That's pretty good.  No, I call it Andy's Mouth Surprise.  It's nice because the flavor of the Starbursts really bring out a similar flavor in the Skittles.


 'Zerts are what I call desserts.  Tray-trays are entrees.  I call sandwiches sammies, sandoozles, or Adam Sandlers.  Air conditioners are cool blasterz, with a z.  I don't know where that came from.  I call cakes big ol' cookies.  I call noodles long-ass rice.  Fried chicken is fri-fri chicky-chick.  Chicken parm is chicky chicky parm parm.  Chicken cacciatore?  Chicky catch.  I call eggs pre-birds, or future birds.  Root beer is super water.  Tortillas are bean blankies.  And I call forks...food rakes.


 Let’s play a different game. I’m gonna say stuff about me and you say, on a scale from one to ten, how interested in that thing you are. Ready?
 Okay.
 I love sunshine and fresh air and early morning walks.
 One.
 I’ve read five biographies of Eleanor Roosevelt.
 One.
 I work at the Parks and Rec...
 ''[Interrupting]'' One.
 That’s what you do.
 One.
 I once kissed a girl in college.
 ''[Smiling]'' Eight.

 One. Zero. Negative a billion. Don’t talk about it anymore, please.


 ''[presenting his cook-off entry]'' Here's mine. It's a hamburger, made out of meat, on a bun, with nothing. Add ketchup if you want, I couldn't care less.


 OK everyone, SHUT UP AND LOOK AT ME!  Welcome to Visions of Nature.  This room has several paintings in it.  Some are big, some are small. People did them and they are here now.  I believe that after this is over they'll be hung in government buildings.  Why the government is involved in an art show is beyond me.  I also think it's pointless for a human to paint scenes of nature when they can just go outside and stand in it.  Anyway, please do not misinterpret the fact that I am talking right now as genuine interest in art and attempt to discuss it with me further.  End of speech.

 Pornography is very difficult to define. In fact, it was Justice Stewart who once said, "I can't define pornography, but I know it when I see it."
 Brandi, how would you define pornography?
 For me, it's when the penis goes in.


 Yes, we're gonna get a dish rack, and shower curtains, and a cutting board, but if you think for one second that I'm not also gonna get that marshmallow shooter so I can shoot you in the face with marshmallows when you're asleep, then you're the dumbest woman I know.
 ''[deeply touched]'' You're going to make me cry.


 Ron refuses to tell anyone when his birthday is; he's even had it redacted on all government documents. Three years of investigations, phone calls, Freedom of Information Act requests, and I still had nothing. Until, a well placed bribe to a gentleman at Baskin Robins revealed... Ron's birthday is on Friday!


 birthdays were invented by Hallmark to sell cards.


 The only thing I'm guilty of is loving Pawnee. And punching Lindsay in the face and shoving a coffee filter down her pants.


 No offense, but maybe you think I'm going too fast 'cause you're going too slow with Ben!
 No offense, but I'm going slow 'cause I might lose my job!
 No offense, but maybe that's a little bit of an excuse for not acting on your feelings!
 No offense, but I don't remember you having a nursing degree in feelings!
 Offense!  That's rude!  I'm gonna go dance.  Douche, you're up!
 Mm-hm!
 Hey, are you OK?  I heard yowling.
 Yeah, I'm very angry and I'm really drunk.  Do you wanna dance with me?  Go get me another snork juice.
 Oh, that's maybe not the best idea for you.
 Forget it!  Jean-Ralphio!
 ''[immediately appears]'' Yes, I'm here!
 Dance up on me!
 Yes, yes, yes!


 This "Snake Juice" is basically rat poison.  Everybody's wasted.
:''[cuts to a drunk and crying Leslie]''
 She didn't even know one thing, I didn't even say one thing and then she asked me the whole thing and I didn't even do it once!
:''[cuts to a drunk Tom]''
 I'm like an elephant, OK?  If I walk into a room, it's like OK, he's in there.
:''[cuts to a drunk and giggling Ben]''
 Baba booey.
:''[cuts to a drunk Andy]''
 Turn this music down. ''[singing]'' Farts and boobs and love and stuff... macaroni salad...
:''[cuts to a drunk April]''
 ''[rapidly speaks Spanish]''
:''[cuts to a drunk Ron, who is wearing April's hat and dancing frantically]''


 There's got to be something we can do. ''[shouts into the next room]'' Ben, is there something we can do?!
:''[silence]''
 Damn it, Ben's not here...


 You've gotta try role play like me and April.
 ...that explains the costume.
 Yeah, like you're her boss and you can't sleep together because sex is forbidden.
 ... That is our actual situation.


 Hello, my name is Ron Swanson. Normally I try never to speak with people, but I've been drinking this Snake Juice thing, and it's damn good. You should buy it.
 Yeah okay, thanks man.
 Son, you should know that my suggestion is essentially a guarantee. ''[hands man glass of Snake Juice]'' Drink this. Now.


 Leslie, we have to go hire a new PR director for the health department.
 Oh my god I'm so hungover. I've never been this hungover.
 I feel great. I ran 5K this morning.
 Really?
 No, I threw up in the shower.


''[Ben and Leslie are interviewing people]''
 Thank you, we'll let you know.
''[Interviewee walks out]''
 And then our heads will explode, and we will die... ''[sigh]''


 It's never too early to learn that the government is a greedy piglet that suckles on the taxpayers' teat until they have sore, chapped nipples. ...I'm gonna need a different metaphor to give this nine year old.


 I'm gonna go see a man about some porcelain, you know what I mean?  I'm not buying cocaine.  I'm going to the bathroom.  The whiz palace, as I like to call it.


:''[after her and Ben's first kiss]''
 Uh-oh.


 Ron Swanson!
 Chris, you have come up with a plan so spectacularly horrible that it might ruin the entire department.
 Now wait a minute...
 my department has to go back to the way it was.
 Give them time.  They'll adjust.
 No they won't.  They're miserable.  Tom only performs when there's someone to impress, so marooning him on freak island isn't helping anyone.  And you made April assistant to everyone?  You know who April hates?  Everyone.  And Jerry can only function if no one is looking.  You shine a light on him and he shrinks up faster than an eskimo's scrotum.
 That's very perceptive, Ron.  And very graphic.


 When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.  I read that one on a can of lemonade.  I like to think it applies to life.


 This spaceship keyboard is driving me crazy! I'm down to one word a minute. And the word is 'perfishisklep'.


 How did you find out?
 We've worked together for a while now.  I'd like to think I know you pretty well.  Plus, Ben butt-dialed me last night.
:''[Ron holds up his phone]''
 ''[over phone]'' OK, OK, and this is how Eleanor Roosevelt would kiss.
 ''[over phone]'' Whoa, Eleanor likes the tongue. Show me Pelosi again.
 ''[over phone]'' OK, lay down...
:''[Ron puts his phone away]''
 Please tell me you hung up before Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
 Unfortunately not.
 Ugh.
 This is a scandal waiting to happen.  If you get caught which you CLEARLY will, Chris will fire you and I won't be able to stop him.
 Ron, we're being very careful.
:''[Ron holds up his phone]''
 ''[over phone]'' Oh President Reagan, my blazer popped open.
 ''[over phone impersonating Ronald Reagan]'' Well, Maggie Thatcher, let me help you with that.  Our countries have had a very special relationship.
 OK, yes...
 ''[over phone]'' Oh no!
 ...You've proven your point.


 Guess I'll be heading home.
 Catching the number 12 bus to Satan's butthole?
 Actually I prefer the number 69 train to Humpsville station.
 Red alert, Swanson!  Your ex-wife's back!
 No kidding, Donna.
 Not her.  The other ex-wife.
 ...Tammy One?
 She's in your office.
:''[They all look at Ron's window and see a woman partially obscured by the blinds]''
 Oh Shit!  ''[runs away in fear]''


 What's the point of doing 10,000 pushups a week if you have no one to do them with. I'd much rather do 5,000 pushups with a lovely woman... sitting on my back to increase my resistance.


 I have cried twice in my life. Once, when I was 7 and was hit by a bus, and again when I learned that L'il Sebastian had passed.


 When I walked in this morning and saw the flag at half mast, I thought, 'Great. Another bureaucrat ate it.' But when I found out it was Li'l Sebastian, ''[sobs]'' Half-mast is too high. Show some damn respect!

== Season 4 ==


:''[Ron bolts out of the office past Leslie, then turns back to her]''
 Knope, follow me.
 Just one second.
 NOW.
:''[Ron grabs Leslie's chair and wheels it down the hallway]''
 Ron! Hey, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, Ron-Ron-Ron-Ron-Ron, what's going on?
 My ex-wife is back.
:''[Ron grabs a footrest off the shoe shine stand]''
 Yeah, I saw her in the courtyard.
 No, my ''other'' ex-wife Tammy - Tammy One.
:''[Leslie gasps]''
 I have accrued 228 personal days. Starting now, I am using all of them. While I'm gone, you're in charge.
:''[Ron plunges the footrest into the wall, steps up, removes an air grate and retrieves a large bag of survival equipment marked "Tammy One" from the duct]''
 Also, I keep a sizable supply of ground chuck in my desk. Remove it, or it will begin to smell. Godspeed.
:''[Ron runs down the hall at full speed, plowing into Jerry in the process.]''


 There you have it, where it is the thing Leslie Knope just said about this situation.


 ''[about Jerry]'' That man has the largest penis I have ever seen.  I actually don't even know if he has mumps; forgot to look.  I was distracted by the largest penis I have ever seen.


 OK, you know what?  Let's cut the crap. Is this audit even real?
 In a sense, yes, but in another, truer sense, no, it is not.  I want Ronald back.  But I had to learn about his finances to make sure my future was protected.  I'm impressed.  He's acquired quite a bit of gold...
 You gold digger!  You are literally a gold digger!



Mothra|Mothra]]. No offense.
 None taken. I'm very flattered.


 It's time to settle this.
 Ah, an old fashioned prairie drink-off.
:''[Tammy Zero opens a jug of alcohol]''
 Ugh, what's in that jug?  It smells like jet fuel!
 That's Swanson family mash liquor.  Made from the finest corn ever grown on American soil.  It's only legal use is to strip varnish off of speed boats.
 If you win, he's all yours, and if I win, I bring him back to the farm for good.
 Wait, what?  That wasn't the deal!
 Pour it.  I'm thirsty. 
 Pour me one too, then.  Let me in here!  I'm gonna join you and if I win, Ron stays here with us.
 Leslie, no, don't drink that.  We use it to burn warts off of the mules!
:''[Leslie and the Tammys take a shot of the liquor]''
 ...POISON!  I made a mistake.  I made a mistake.


:''[Leslie is drunk on Swanson liquor]''
 She's had enough!
 That's not how it works. She's out.
 Wait, I'm subbing in.
 April, don't. That stuff will melt the shell off of a snail.
 I'm Puerto Rican, I can handle it.
:''[April takes a swig of the liquor]''
 ''[spits out liquor in disgust]'' FUCK! OH MY GOD!


 Welcome to "Thoughts For Your Thoughts."  I'm Derry Murbles, filling in for David Parker who took off for 8 months to study the migration patterns of our nation's squirrels.  He has not been heard from since.


 Drink up, Tom.  I'm gonna go powder my nose... amongst other things... if you know what I mean.
 Is she going to powder her vagina?


 I wrote a book. "The First Historical Guide to Pawnee." I wrote it as a reference for myself, but then my campaign advisors said we should make it a big wide release. So we had people contribute, we added pictures, and we removed a lot of my poems and emotional ramblings and pictures of unicorns and here it is!


 So Ben, tell us about Star Trek.
 Well, they're making a sequel. ''[pause]'' I assume with the same alternate storyline, but if they expect us to believe that the sexual tension is between Uhura and Spock and not Kirk, then, well lets just say the message boards are on fire.
:''[pause]''
 ''[drunkenly]'' You know what I wanna do? I wanna take you both home, bend you the ''[bleep]'' over and ''[bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep]'' at the same time.


Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]?
 Nothing is wrong, just do your job.  And they would never cancel Game of Thrones.  It's a crossover hit.  It's not just for fantasy enthusiasts, they're telling human stories in a fantasy world.


 acupuncture. It's great for your back and your rear. Needles in your face, pleasure in yo' base.


  Hey Ron, good to see ya!  Weren't you a pirate last year?
 Yes.  This is my Halloween costume.


  Look, I don't like to throw around the word "butthead" often.  If you call everyone a butthead, it kind of loses its impact.  But I can say without hesitation that Tom is being a real dick.


 Well, Entertainment 720 is dead.  It's up in company heaven along with Pets.com, Blockbuster, and Ask Jeeves.  My company is no better than a company where you ask a fake butler to Google things for you.


 What religion am I?  Well, I'm a practicing none of your ''[bleep]'' business.


 I need a few more volunteers.  Andy, will you be Iceland?
 The bad guys from Mighty Ducks 2?  Don't think so.
 OK, how about Japan?
 The bad guys from Karate Kid 2?  Even worse.  How about Germany?  They've never been the bad guys.


 It's a white flag, and you better start waving it now, Leslie!
 The only thing I'll be waving is your decapitated head on a stick in front of your weeping mother!
 ...Good Lord.


 I value a good education, so I don't want to see Andy waste his time in college.  Of all my co-workers, he's one of a small number whom I don't actively root against.  Ah, there I go getting all sappy.


 I'm just freaking out.  The only thing we have left is work and now he doesn't want to work together anymore.  What does that all mean?
 I think you know what it means.
 Yeah.  I should just drag out that tiny park project for as long as possible so Ben and I can keep working together.
 That's almost exactly the opposite of what I meant.
 No, what I'll do is I'll get the neighborhood all riled up and then maybe they'll ask for an environmental impact report, and then Ben and I will work together for at least another year.  Good idea, Ann.
 Leslie, for God's sakes...
 No, Ann, please I beg of you, will you just shut your beautiful pie hole?  Just sit there and let me stare are at you while you silently support me on this gameplan.
 Leslie...
 ''[hugging Ann]'' Shh Ann...
 Leslie...
Your quiet support means the world to me, as does your tacit endorsement of all my behaviors.


 Tom, will you please tell the committee why we were kissing?
 An online dating site randomly paired us up, so as a joke I thought it would be funny to pretend you and I were dating.  And then you kissed me as a joke to shut me up.
 But we never had any other romantic contact after that?
 No, that would be like dating my older sister's elderly aunt.


 Ms. Swanson, do you - as you claimed - have evidence that links Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt to law-breaking?
 Absolutely.  I have several photographs that will defintively prove...
 May I remind you that you are under oath and if you lie I will fire you and have you prosecuted.
 Nothing!  They will defintively prove nothing.  Oh, you cut me off.  I don't have any evidence!  Oh Chris, so silly.  OK bye, guys!  Leslie, have fun with this trial.  Yay!


 Your campaign advisors quit.  Big deal.  You're running for city council again, Leslie.  With our help.
 April Ludgate. Youth Outreach and Director of New Media.
 Tom Haverford.  Image Consultant, Swagger Coach.
 Ann Perkins.  Office Manager and Volunteer Coordinator.
 Andy Dwyer.  Security, Sweets, Body Man, Javelin, if need be.
 Donna Meagle.  Transpo', AKA rides in my Benz.
 Wh...You guys didn't tell me we were doing this.  I did not know I was supposed to come up with something.  I...
 Ron Swanson.  Any other damn thing you might need.
 Guys, it's so much work.  I can't ask you to put your lives on hold.
 Find one person here who you haven't helped by putting your life on hold.
 ''[choked up]'' I don't know what to say...except let's go win an election!


 Welcome, Mr. Saperstein.
 Thanks so much!
 I will just show you to your cubicle.
 I can't wait.  I bet it's a big one, huh Barney?
 The temp agency said that you are fluent in QuickBooks Pro, correct?
 Oh right yeah, we should cover that.  Y'see, my resume might not actually be accurate, right?  So I have no idea what you're talking about.  Don't know what QuickBooks are.
 You don't have any accounting experience?
 No, no, no, Barney, c'mon.  But you don't have to be an accountant to know that this girl is a 10.  Yo, what up, Diaz?  Come here often?
 To my job?
 Oh, sharp mouth on her also.  Shut it.
 Is this the new temp who's supposed to help me with the spreadsheets?
 You wanna talk about spreading the sheets, we can go back to my place and I will rock your—
 You're fired!
 That makes sense.  So I just go out the same way I came in?


 Ann, you beautiful tropical fish.


 It's true. I no longer have highly trained, professional campaign managers.  So what?  Are most murders committed by highly trained, professional assassins?  No, they're committed by friends and coworkers!  ...That analogy was way better in my head.


 He is attractive, and charming, and his family employs half the town.  But so what? I am a lifelong government bureaucrat who's well versed in the issues.  And those are the kind of sexy qualifications that win elections.


 Thank you, John, for coming in.  The Public Works department is wonderful and you are the best idea man in the business.
 Also we're cancelling all of your ongoing projects.
 What?  What about the Pawnee River dam?
 Dam's dead.  Have a nice day.
 Where will all the water go?
 Wherever it's headed now.  The important thing is the dam is never happening and your dream has been crushed.
 We're very sorry.
 I am not.  Good meeting.


 Is everybody feeling good?
 Oh, I don't know Jerry.  It's Sunday night, I'm making phone calls to strangers, and you're in my house.  My life couldn't be worse.


 ''[on bowling]'' Straight down the middle.  No hook, no spin, no fuss.  Anything more and this becomes figure skating.


 When I eat, it's the food that's scared.


 April hates Valentine's Day. And brunch, and outside, and smiling.  ''[laughs]''  She's weird.


 Hey, Kris Kross, can we change up the music?  It kinda sounds like the end of a movie about a monk who killed himself.
 It is.


   I'm sorry, I was talking to these ribs.


 Look Knope, I've always liked you, but the Newports run this town, and frankly they've donated a lot of money to the department.
 Mo' money, mo' problems, that's what I always say.
 How about mo' money, mo' protective kevlar vests that save lives?
 I-I...sometimes I say that, too.
 I understand you need to think about it, but if you were gonna make a decision...
 The guys are throwing me a little retirement thing tonight at O'Flinigans.  There's gonna be beer so why don't you swing by, I'll give you an answer.  Weirdo can come, too.
 Alright.
 Let's go.
 Oh hey, uh, may I say...
 Don't.
 ...that the boys in blue...
 Stop.
 ...are heroes.  Obviously some more than others.  Oh boy, here it comes........9/11.
 And we're walking.
 OK.


 Uh, yes, uh, Leslie Knope is a female person with whom I was, uh, involved.  We had ''[clears throat]'' romantic...romantical involvement until I relocated to San Diego.  Which is a...that's, uh, in California, which is southwest of here by a number of miles, so, uh, we terminated our involvement at that time.


 We're not big on hospitality.  The Meagles are a cold people.


 Never half-ass two things. Whole-ass one thing.


 "Not enough ramps" is the number three complaint among Pawnee seniors, right behind "Everything hurts" and "I'm dying."


 It reminds me of when my dad made me choose which of my pet calves to slaughter with my own hands for my 6th birthday.  I couldn't choose, so I slaughtered both of them.  And they were delicious.


 It says "nympho" on the butt in silver sparkly letters.  Nympho means you're addicted to sex, and since it's on the butt, there are other implications as well.  So those are a maybe.


 Why are you here eating alone?
 I'm not.  I'm surrounded by friends.  Friends I don't know yet.  And I'm engrossed in this book.  It's the true story of a woman born with no arms and no legs who attempted to swim the English Channel.
 That's impossible.
 Oh, she drowned immediately.  It's kind of a sad story.


 I've gotten to know the city councilmen pretty well because of my campaign.  If you hear them talking about "that blonde pain in the ass", that's me.


 Now if you'll excuse me, there's a hot, spinning cone of meat in that Greek restaurant next door.  I don't know what it is, but I'd like to eat the whole thing.


 If I had to have anybody tell me that I have cancer, I would want it to be me.


 So you do a lot of investing?
 We dabble.  I recently invested in some shirts at a garage sale.  Left those at a Wendy's on the way home, so... ''[chuckles, lifts up wine glass and stares at it]'' The economy.


 In a few minutes, we'll walk in there, we'll give him our demands, and then BAM, I start crying.


 If I Had To Pick A Dude.  Ben is Eagle Two.
 Oh thank God.


30am, I woke up from a dream that felt so real it had to be a premonition.  Me, Drake, and the T-Mobile girl were playing baccarat on a private jet.  Ann Perkins walks up to me and says "Tommy, tomorrow night, I'm taking you back".  Then Blue Ivy Carter high-fived me and gave me $40 million dollars.  It was all so real.


 Your victory speech, Councilwoman Knope.
 Someday, when I'm more emotionally stable, I want to read the concession speech you wrote for me.
 I never wrote it.


 City Council, bitches!

== Season 5 ==


 You OK, boss?
 No, not really.  I know I should be focusing on this cleanup, but all I think about is Ben laughing in a helicopter with Hot Rebecca. 
 Who's Hot Rebecca?
 She's just this jealousy amalgam I created.  ''[Andy stares confused]'' I combined all of the giant dark-haired smartphone power goddesses into one woman called Hot Rebecca.
 Oooh.
 I mean Ben's life is filled with senators and briefings and Super PACs.  I can't even get a meeting with some bureaucrat.
 ''[laughing]'' I don't even know what a bureaucrat is.  Everything is gonna be fine with you and Ben because if I know Ben, he too is an amalgam.
 No.
 Yeah.  Point is you're better than Hot Rebecca.  You're Kickass Leslie.  Long distance relationships are never easy but you never ever give up on stuff.
 Thanks.
 That's what makes you...
 Nope.
 ...an amalgam.  Nailed it.


 Your work is appreciated.  Eat some corn.


 Well, Paunch Burger just recently came out with a new 128 ounce option.  Most people call it a gallon, but they call it the Regular.  Then there is a horrifying 512 ounce version that they call Child Size.  How is this a child size soda?
 Well, it's roughly the size of a two-year old child, if the child were liquified.  It's a real bargain at $1.59.


 I'm never gonna be a cop.  I'm gonna have to be a robber.


 Are you busy?  And writing Star Trek fan fiction doesn't count.
 Ha.  ...And I finished that last week.


 The perm must wait, Autumn.  THE...PERM...MUST...WAIT.


 Guurrl, you look like Annie Oakley and Pippi Longstocking had a baby and I LOVE it.

 ''(on phone with Leslie)'' I love you.
 I love you too. What are you wearing?
 I can't do that right now.
''(Leslie laughs)''


 I'm just saying, you should have put "spoiler alert" on all those death canoe tweets. Also, not safe for work. You know, a lot of what you wrote was really profane. 
 [''on her phone''] That movie's 25 years old, Morris. And if you don't like how I tweet, don't follow me. 
 What are you doing now? I'm talking to you.
 I'm live tweeting this dumbass conversation.

 Marry me?
 Oh, yeah!


 If there's anyone who can bring my parents together, its NO ONE. No one can bring my parents together. 

                  
 I'm so happy I want to shout it from the rooftops!
 And she has. We've gotten several noise complaints/
 We're getting married!!
 All right.


 I can never tell if people are lying to me. I hope that doesn't come up in my police work
 
 Just call me, Municipal Bond 


 I started working on something very important. Can you help me?
 Yes sir.
 ''(To the camera)'' Its a flight of stairs leading nowhere. 
 
 I don't know if you knew this, but Leslie was born in Eagleton.
 Do not blame me for the sins of my mother!


 I'm allergic to sushi. Every time I eat more than 80 pieces, I throw up.
 
 Merry Congratuchristmas!
 What?
 
 It's cold outside and I can't wear mittens because they're not flattering to my hands!


 To Tom Haverford! Wooo!
 And to my wife Rihanna! We truly did find love in a hopeless place
 
 Anything that can be penis shaped, will be penis shaped! 


 I can't keep referring to basketball players as Khloe Kardashian's husband and his friends.

 
 You know what? I think men are better than women.
 She's kidding
 No I'm not. they provide for us and we must obey them because they are our masters.

 
 You are officially a baller.
 I've been a baller since birth, son. Now, I'm an athlete.

 
 Jerry. I never thought I would say this, but I am so glad you're here.

 
 It's not that bad. Nobody got hurt.
 It's extremely bad! I love this woman, and I just wanna show her that I'm capable of watching her children without something horrible happening. [''Ann's mouth is open''] What?!
 Did you just say you love Diane? 
 No. I did not. 
 Yes, you did! That is so cute!
 For god's sake, Hanson, will you please focus on the larger problem?


 Ann is giving up on love and deciding to have a baby with herself. And she has only been dating herself for six weeks. If she was dating a guy for six weeks, and they decided to have a kid, I'd be like, "Congratulations, Ann... and Channing Tatum." Because that is the only scenario that would make sense to me.

 
 There's been a mistake. You've accidentally given me the food that my food eats. 

 
 [''trying to pick a caterer for his wedding''] Tom, what about you?
 Caterer number one's presentation was simple, mm, yet exhausting. Number two's was subtle and provocative, like a coy dutch woman guarding a dark secret. 
 Nothing you're saying is helpful.
 But number three's told a story- a story from a book I wouldn't read but I would watch the movie of. 
 That's nonsense. 

 
 So tomorrow, I lead a public forum in Leslie's Fleetwood Mac sex pants.
 Fleetwood Mac sex pants. New band name. I call it. [''snaps fingers''] Ooh, you know what? Maybe just Fleetwood Mac. 

 
 It smells like some vomit took a dump in here.

 
 [''Ben, Ron, and Chris all have food poisoning''] I didn't eat those stupid mini-calzones. Haver-Food rule number six- Never eat anything with a sauce I have to dip myself. Drizzle it on for me. I'm not your maid.


 Damnit, Jamm. I should have had animal control kill you.
 Huh.. Who do you want me to kill...I'll kill them.

 
 The tables showed up which is good, but there are no chairs which is bad.

 
 ''[fielding different questions]'' The next thing you'll want to do is ditch the terrier and get yourself a proper dog. Any dog under 50 pounds is a cat, and cats are pointless. Come to the Gala. Next caller. 
:''Grapes of Wrath'', chocolate-chip ice cream, and Johnny Cash.
:Don't trust big banks or small banks. Banks are ponzi schemes run by morons.
:Your house isn't haunted. You're lonely.
:Whatever happened to, "Hey, I have some apples. Would you like to buy them?" "Yes, thank you." That's as complicated as it should be to open a business in this country.
 ''Bridge on the River Kwai'', ''Patton'', and ''Herbie Fully Loaded''. My girlfriend's kids love it. It's pretty funny. Next caller.

 
 How did you get the word out?
 Well, Ron went on Joan's show and kicked ass.
 I also helped a child perform a tracheotomy on his elderly uncle. It's been a very rewarding day.

 
 Love? Love fades away. But things? Things are forever.


 Did you just pee your pants?
 Just a dab.
 You nasty Jerry.

 
 I hate to say this, but Ann Perkins has terrible taste in rings. 

 
 When I heard Leslie was getting married, I was all, "to Ben or to Game of Thrones."
 Nooooo... Jerry!

 
 [''tying his bow-tie''] Okay, did I- did I do it right? [''the tie is crooked''] How's it looks. 
 Terrible. And perfect. I promised myself I was not going to cry tonight. And I have already broken that promise five times. But I will not... break it a sixth. 
 Go ahead and let it out, buddy. It's okay. 
 I have something for you. 
 All right. 
 It is the letter from the statehouse... telling us that we have been assigned to Pawnee. Dated May 1st, 2010. 
 [''quietly''] No way.
 We were supposed to be here eight weeks. I'm so happy that those eight weeks turned into three years, and that you met Leslie, and that we both found a home. 
 Damn it, you're transferring your crying thing over to me. 
 It's okay, buddy, let it out. [''they laugh'']

 
 [''to Leslie''] Before we go inside, I'd like to say something. You are a wonderful person. [''voice breaks''] Your friendship means a lot to me. And you look very beautiful.

 
 People who buy things are suckers.


 Ah, who am I going to do? I just opened a can of whoop ass on myself!
 
 I wish this office was just walls.


 Before I write that letter, you have to spend a whole week doing everything I say.
 So what, I have to be your slave or something?
 No, you have to be my friend
 Ugh, that's so much worse. 
 
 You're a smart successful young man with an adorable belly.


 Last year I won an organic gardening contest.
 Who were you competing against?
 My own taste buds. 

 
 skim milk, which is water that's lying about being milk

 
 May I say for the record that is a dope pocket square

 
 HIs nickname around the office is Softypants Mchuggable. 

 
 We should sue Jamm's parents for spawning a human turd burger.
 How many drinks of alcohol do you consume a week?
 One.
 That's it? One drink?
 One shelf.
 Do you exercise?
 Yes. Lovemaking and woodworking.
 Do you have any history of mental illness in your family

 Hello, Orin. Thank you so much for applying, now leave.
 Hey, give him a chance. [''to Orin''] What makes you qualified for animal control?
 I studied zoology in college, and I can control animals with my mind. 
 Get out.
 I made you say that. [''gets up and leaves'']
 I liked him.

 April, I got a present for you. [''holding a basket full of lotion bottles''] 
 I don't like lotion. I like my hands to be cracked and calloused like a railway worker. 
 I know. I filled the bottles with fake blood, vinegar, and mud. 
 [''smiles''] Really? Thanks.


 Normally, if given a choice between doing something and nothing, I'd choose to do nothing. But I will do something if it helps someone else do nothing. I'd work all night if it meant nothing got done.

 
 Stop bidding on my waffle iron.
 You're futuremrstigerwoods? 
 I made that profile, like, ten years ago. I don't know how to change it. The point is I'm getting that waffle iron for Leslie for Breakfast Day. 
 Uh, no, you're not. I'm getting it for her for Waffle Day. Wait, you have a breakfast day too? Mine's in June.
 Please, Ben. This is the celebration of the anniversary of the first time we hung out at JJ's, which she considers the beginning of our friendship. 
 Well, imagine being married to her. It's like being smothered with a hand-quilted pillow filled with cherished memories. I can't believe I'm complaining about how thoughtful my wife is. [''loud to the room''] Sorry, honey. I love you. 
 Look, I have known her for longer, I have five years' worth of anniversaries, so I have seniority. 
 Oh, god. Oh, no! We've lost the auction. 
 What- no!
 Somebody swooped in at the last second, and now we're both screwed. 
 No! Okay, Tyrion Lannister, why don't you just cast a spell and get us the waffle iron back?
 Oh, okay. I don't even have time to tell you how wrong you are. [''pause''] Actually, it's gonna bug me if I don't. The Lannisters while very wealthy, do not possess the magical abilities of, say, the warlocks of Qarth for example.
 This is why we don't hang out. 
 One time my refrigerator stopped working and I had no idea what do to! I just moved. 
 money, fear and hunger.
 I keep getting outbid by someone call Tall Tyrion Lannister. What kind of name is that?
 Are you kidding me? Tyrion Lannister? Lord of Casterly Rock? The half man? You don't watch Game of Thrones?
 No, do you?
 Hell, yeah! Have you seen those Dothraki dudes? They can get it! Everyone on that show can get it!

 
 My spirit blood is on your hands.


 Ron, ask me if I am sad.
 No
 
 Andy will never be the new Jerry. Nothing embarrasses him. He is like a giant puppy with no shame.
 
 I'm gonna buy some sweat pants and a Nicholas Sparks novel. Might as well lean into it.

 Look, Hogwarts.
 No, that's Buckingham Palace. Hogwarts is fictional. You do know that, don't you? It's important to me that you know that.
 
 History began on July 4, 1776. Everything that happened before that was a mistake.

 I'd invite you for a drink, but where would we find one here?
 Are you kidding? This is London. There's a pub over there, there's a pub over there, and there's a pub between those two butcher shops.
 Let's go to that one, but we'll be stopping by those two butcher shops first.
 
 I thought you needed some air, even if that air is fouled by the stench of European socialism.
 
 Your son, he's my best friend, he's like a brother to me, but he's a disaster. And your daughter, she needs to be put in a mental institution. On an island. In space.

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had peeped into the
book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or
conversations?"

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so
very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh
dear! I shall be too late!" But when the Rabbit actually took a watch
out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice
started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take
out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after
it and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under
the hedge. In another moment, down went Alice after it!

[Illustration]

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed
to be a very deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time, as she went down, to look about her. First, she tried to
make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything;
then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were
filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and
pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as
she passed. It was labeled "ORANGE MARMALADE," but, to her great
disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so
managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.

Down, down, down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing
else to do, so Alice soon began talking to herself. "Dinah'll miss me
very much to-night, I should think!" (Dinah was the cat.) "I hope
they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish
you were down here with me!" Alice felt that she was dozing off, when
suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry
leaves, and the fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up,
but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage and
the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a
moment to be lost. Away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to
hear it say, as it turned a corner, "Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late
it's getting!" She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but
the Rabbit was no longer to be seen.

She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of
lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all 'round the hall, but
they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side
and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,
wondering how she was ever to get out again.

Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of solid glass. There
was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first idea was that
this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the
locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, it
would not open any of them. However, on the second time 'round, she came
upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a
little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key
in the lock, and to her great delight, it fitted!

[Illustration]

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and looked along the passage
into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of
that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and
those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the
doorway. "Oh," said Alice, "how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!
I think I could, if I only knew how to begin."

Alice went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on
it, or at any rate, a book of rules for shutting people up like
telescopes. This time she found a little bottle on it ("which certainly
was not here before," said Alice), and tied 'round the neck of the
bottle was a paper label, with the words "DRINK ME" beautifully printed
on it in large letters.

"No, I'll look first," she said, "and see whether it's marked '_poison_'
or not," for she had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle
marked "poison," it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or
later. However, this bottle was _not_ marked "poison," so Alice ventured
to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of
cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered
toast), she very soon finished it off.

       *       *       *       *       *

"What a curious feeling!" said Alice. "I must be shutting up like a
telescope!"

And so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden.

After awhile, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the
door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her
best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery,
and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
sat down and cried.

"Come, there's no use in crying like that!" said Alice to herself rather
sharply. "I advise you to leave off this minute!" She generally gave
herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and
sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her
eyes.

Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
she opened it and found in it a very small cake, on which the words "EAT
ME" were beautifully marked in currants. "Well, I'll eat it," said
Alice, "and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either way I'll
get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!"

She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself, "Which way? Which
way?" holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was
growing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size. So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake.

[Illustration]




II--THE POOL OF TEARS


"Curiouser and curiouser!" cried Alice (she was so much surprised that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English). "Now I'm
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-by, feet! Oh,
my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings
for you now, dears? I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you."

Just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in
fact, she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took
up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.

Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
hopeless than ever. She sat down and began to cry again.

She went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all
'round her and reaching half down the hall.

After a time, she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid-gloves in
one hand and a large fan in the other. He came trotting along in a
great hurry, muttering to himself, "Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh!
_won't_ she be savage if I've kept her waiting!"

When the Rabbit came near her, Alice began, in a low, timid voice, "If
you please, sir--" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white
kid-gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he
could go.

[Illustration]

Alice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the
time she went on talking. "Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day!
And yesterday things went on just as usual. _Was_ I the same when I got
up this morning? But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in
the world am I?' Ah, _that's_ the great puzzle!"

As she said this, she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see
that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid-gloves while
she was talking. "How _can_ I have done that?" she thought. "I must be
growing small again." She got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and was
going on shrinking rapidly. She soon found out that the cause of this
was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily, just in time to
save herself from shrinking away altogether.

"That _was_ a narrow escape!" said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence. "And
now for the garden!" And she ran with all speed back to the little door;
but, alas! the little door was shut again and the little golden key was
lying on the glass table as before. "Things are worse than ever,"
thought the poor child, "for I never was so small as this before,
never!"

As she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another moment,
splash! she was up to her chin in salt-water. Her first idea was that
she had somehow fallen into the sea. However, she soon made out that she
was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.

[Illustration]

Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
off, and she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it
was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.

"Would it be of any use, now," thought Alice, "to speak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here that I should think very
likely it can talk; at any rate, there's no harm in trying." So she
began, "O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
of swimming about here, O Mouse!" The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but
it said nothing.

"Perhaps it doesn't understand English," thought Alice. "I dare say it's
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror." So she began
again: "Où est ma chatte?" which was the first sentence in her French
lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to
quiver all over with fright. "Oh, I beg your pardon!" cried Alice
hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings. "I quite
forgot you didn't like cats."

"Not like cats!" cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. "Would
_you_ like cats, if you were me?"

"Well, perhaps not," said Alice in a soothing tone; "don't be angry
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I think you'd
take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a dear,
quiet thing." The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it
must be really offended. "We won't talk about her any more, if you'd
rather not."

"We, indeed!" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of its
tail. "As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always _hated_
cats--nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!"

[Illustration: Alice at the Mad Tea Party.]

"I won't indeed!" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation. "Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs? There is such a nice
little dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the
rats and--oh, dear!" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. "I'm afraid I've
offended it again!" For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as
it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.

So she called softly after it, "Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
won't talk about cats, or dogs either, if you don't like them!" When the
Mouse heard this, it turned 'round and swam slowly back to her; its face
was quite pale, and it said, in a low, trembling voice, "Let us get to
the shore and then I'll tell you my history and you'll understand why it
is I hate cats and dogs."

It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo,
a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the
way and the whole party swam to the shore.

[Illustration]




III--A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE


They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross and uncomfortable.

[Illustration]

The first question, of course, was how to get dry again. They had a
consultation about this and after a few minutes, it seemed quite natural
to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had
known them all her life.

At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of some authority among
them, called out, "Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I'll_ soon
make you dry enough!" They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with
the Mouse in the middle.

"Ahem!" said the Mouse with an important air. "Are you all ready? This
is the driest thing I know. Silence all 'round, if you please! 'William
the Conqueror, whose cause was favored by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the Earls of
Mercia and Northumbria'--"

"Ugh!" said the Lory, with a shiver.

"--'And even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it
advisable'--"

"Found _what_?" said the Duck.

"Found _it_," the Mouse replied rather crossly; "of course, you know
what 'it' means."

"I know what 'it' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing," said the
Duck; "it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
archbishop find?"

The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, "'--found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the
crown.'--How are you getting on now, my dear?" it continued, turning to
Alice as it spoke.

"As wet as ever," said Alice in a melancholy tone; "it doesn't seem to
dry me at all."

"In that case," said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, "I move that
the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies--"

"Speak English!" said the Eaglet. "I don't know the meaning of half
those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!"

"What I was going to say," said the Dodo in an offended tone, "is that
the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race."

"What _is_ a Caucus-race?" said Alice.

[Illustration]

"Why," said the Dodo, "the best way to explain it is to do it." First it
marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, and then all the party
were placed along the course, here and there. There was no "One, two,
three and away!" but they began running when they liked and left off
when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.
However, when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite
dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out, "The race is over!" and they
all crowded 'round it, panting and asking, "But who has won?"

This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought.
At last it said, "_Everybody_ has won, and _all_ must have prizes."

"But who is to give the prizes?" quite a chorus of voices asked.

"Why, _she_, of course," said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
finger; and the whole party at once crowded 'round her, calling out, in
a confused way, "Prizes! Prizes!"

Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand into her
pocket and pulled out a box of comfits (luckily the salt-water had not
got into it) and handed them 'round as prizes. There was exactly one
a-piece, all 'round.

The next thing was to eat the comfits; this caused some noise and
confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
However, it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and
begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

"You promised to tell me your history, you know," said Alice, "and why
it is you hate--C and D," she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
would be offended again.

"Mine is a long and a sad tale!" said the Mouse, turning to Alice and
sighing.

"It _is_ a long tail, certainly," said Alice, looking down with wonder
at the Mouse's tail, "but why do you call it sad?" And she kept on
puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the
tale was something like this:--

    "Fury said to
      a mouse, That
         he met in the
            house, 'Let
              us both go
                to law: _I_
                 will prosecute
               _you_.--
                 Come, I'll
              take no denial:
             We
           must have
        the trial;
     For really
    this morning
    I've
    nothing
    to do.'
    Said the
     mouse to
      the cur,
       'Such a
        trial, dear
           sir, With
               no jury
                or judge,
                   would
                  be wasting
                our
             breath.'
         'I'll be
        judge,
       I'll be
      jury,'
     said
    cunning
    old
     Fury;
      'I'll
       try
        the
         whole
          cause,
          and
         condemn
       you to
    death.'"

"You are not attending!" said the Mouse to Alice, severely. "What are
you thinking of?"

"I beg your pardon," said Alice very humbly, "you had got to the fifth
bend, I think?"

"You insult me by talking such nonsense!" said the Mouse, getting up and
walking away.

"Please come back and finish your story!" Alice called after it. And the
others all joined in chorus, "Yes, please do!" But the Mouse only shook
its head impatiently and walked a little quicker.

"I wish I had Dinah, our cat, here!" said Alice. This caused a
remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at
once, and a Canary called out in a trembling voice, to its children,
"Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!" On various
pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone.

"I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah! Nobody seems to like her down here and
I'm sure she's the best cat in the world!" Poor Alice began to cry
again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while,
however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance
and she looked up eagerly.

IV--THE RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL


It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; Alice heard it
muttering to itself, "The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh, my dear paws! Oh, my
fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?" Alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves
and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in
the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,
had vanished completely.

Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, and called to her, in an angry tone,
"Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you doing out here? Run home this moment and
fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!"

"He took me for his housemaid!" said Alice, as she ran off. "How
surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!" As she said this, she
came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name "W. RABBIT" engraved upon it. She went in without
knocking and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves.

By this time, Alice had found her way into a tidy little room with a
table in the window, and on it a fan and two or three pairs of tiny
white kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was
just going to leave the room, when her eyes fell upon a little bottle
that stood near the looking-glass. She uncorked it and put it to her
lips, saying to herself, "I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for,
really, I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!"

Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing
against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being
broken. She hastily put down the bottle, remarking, "That's quite
enough--I hope I sha'n't grow any more."

Alas! It was too late to wish that! She went on growing and growing and
very soon she had to kneel down on the floor. Still she went on growing,
and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window and one foot
up the chimney, and said to herself, "Now I can do no more, whatever
happens. What _will_ become of me?"

[Illustration]

Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect
and she grew no larger. After a few minutes she heard a voice outside
and stopped to listen.

"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!" said the voice. "Fetch me my gloves this moment!"
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
the Rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large
as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it.

Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it; but as
the door opened inwards and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,
that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself, "Then I'll
go 'round and get in at the window."

"_That_ you won't!" thought Alice; and after waiting till she fancied
she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
hand and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame or something of that sort.

Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--"Pat! Pat! Where are you?" And
then a voice she had never heard before, "Sure then, I'm here! Digging
for apples, yer honor!"

"Here! Come and help me out of this! Now tell me, Pat, what's that in
the window?"

"Sure, it's an arm, yer honor!"

"Well, it's got no business there, at any rate; go and take it away!"

There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear whispers
now and then, and at last she spread out her hand again and made another
snatch in the air. This time there were _two_ little shrieks and more
sounds of broken glass. "I wonder what they'll do next!" thought Alice.
"As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they _could_!"

She waited for some time without hearing anything more. At last came a
rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many voices all
talking together. She made out the words: "Where's the other ladder?
Bill's got the other--Bill! Here, Bill! Will the roof bear?--Who's to go
down the chimney?--Nay, _I_ sha'n't! _You_ do it! Here, Bill! The master
says you've got to go down the chimney!"

Alice drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till
she heard a little animal scratching and scrambling about in the chimney
close above her; then she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what
would happen next.

The first thing she heard was a general chorus of "There goes Bill!"
then the Rabbit's voice alone--"Catch him, you by the hedge!" Then
silence and then another confusion of voices--"Hold up his head--Brandy
now--Don't choke him--What happened to you?"

Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, "Well, I hardly know--No
more, thank ye. I'm better now--all I know is, something comes at me
like a Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!"

After a minute or two of silence, they began moving about again, and
Alice heard the Rabbit say, "A barrowful will do, to begin with."

"A barrowful of _what_?" thought Alice. But she had not long to doubt,
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window and some of them hit her in the face. Alice noticed, with some
surprise, that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they
lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head. "If I eat one of
these cakes," she thought, "it's sure to make _some_ change in my size."

So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through
the door, she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little
animals and birds waiting outside. They all made a rush at Alice the
moment she appeared, but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found
herself safe in a thick wood.

[Illustration: "The Duchess tucked her arm affectionately into
Alice's."]

"The first thing I've got to do," said Alice to herself, as she
wandered about in the wood, "is to grow to my right size again; and the
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I suppose I
ought to eat or drink something or other, but the great question is
'What?'"

Alice looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but
she could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or
drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near
her, about the same height as herself. She stretched herself up on
tiptoe and peeped over the edge and her eyes immediately met those of a
large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top, with its arms
folded, quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice
of her or of anything else.

[Illustration]




V--ADVICE FROM A CATERPILLAR


At last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed
Alice in a languid, sleepy voice.

"Who are _you_?" said the Caterpillar.

[Illustration]

Alice replied, rather shyly, "I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at
least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must
have changed several times since then."

"What do you mean by that?" said the Caterpillar, sternly. "Explain
yourself!"

"I can't explain _myself_, I'm afraid, sir," said Alice, "because I'm
not myself, you see--being so many different sizes in a day is very
confusing." She drew herself up and said very gravely, "I think you
ought to tell me who _you_ are, first."

"Why?" said the Caterpillar.

As Alice could not think of any good reason and the Caterpillar seemed
to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.

"Come back!" the Caterpillar called after her. "I've something important
to say!" Alice turned and came back again.

"Keep your temper," said the Caterpillar.

"Is that all?" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
could.

"No," said the Caterpillar.

It unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said,
"So you think you're changed, do you?"

"I'm afraid, I am, sir," said Alice. "I can't remember things as I
used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!"

"What size do you want to be?" asked the Caterpillar.

"Oh, I'm not particular as to size," Alice hastily replied, "only one
doesn't like changing so often, you know. I should like to be a _little_
larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind," said Alice. "Three inches is such a
wretched height to be."

"It is a very good height indeed!" said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing
itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).

In a minute or two, the Caterpillar got down off the mushroom and
crawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it went, "One side
will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow
shorter."

"One side of _what_? The other side of _what_?" thought Alice to
herself.

"Of the mushroom," said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
aloud; and in another moment, it was out of sight.

Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying
to make out which were the two sides of it. At last she stretched her
arms 'round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge
with each hand.

"And now which is which?" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent
blow underneath her chin--it had struck her foot!

She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, as she was
shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other
bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was
hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last and managed to
swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit....

"Come, my head's free at last!" said Alice; but all she could see, when
she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise
like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.

"Where _have_ my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I
can't see you?" She was delighted to find that her neck would bend
about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in
curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among
the leaves, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry--a large
pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its
wings.

[Illustration]

"Serpent!" cried the Pigeon.

"I'm _not_ a serpent!" said Alice indignantly. "Let me alone!"

"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried
hedges," the Pigeon went on, "but those serpents! There's no pleasing
them!"

Alice was more and more puzzled.

"As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs," said the Pigeon,
"but I must be on the look-out for serpents, night and day! And just as
I'd taken the highest tree in the wood," continued the Pigeon, raising
its voice to a shriek, "and just as I was thinking I should be free of
them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh,
Serpent!"

"But I'm _not_ a serpent, I tell you!" said Alice. "I'm a--I'm a--I'm a
little girl," she added rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number
of changes she had gone through that day.

"You're looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough," said the Pigeon;
"and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a
serpent?"

"It matters a good deal to _me_," said Alice hastily; "but I'm not
looking for eggs, as it happens, and if I was, I shouldn't want
_yours_--I don't like them raw."

"Well, be off, then!" said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as
she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and
every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After awhile she
remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and
she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the
other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.

It was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it
felt quite strange at first. "The next thing is to get into that
beautiful garden--how _is_ that to be done, I wonder?" As she said this,
she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about
four feet high. "Whoever lives there," thought Alice, "it'll never do to
come upon them _this_ size; why, I should frighten them out of their
wits!" She did not venture to go near the house till she had brought
herself down to nine inches high.




VI--PIG AND PEPPER


For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, when suddenly a
footman in livery came running out of the wood (judging by his face
only, she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door
with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a
round face and large eyes like a frog.

[Illustration]

The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, "For the
Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet." The
Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, "From the Queen. An
invitation for the Duchess to play croquet." Then they both bowed low
and their curls got entangled together.

When Alice next peeped out, the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was
sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.
Alice went timidly up to the door and knocked.

"There's no sort of use in knocking," said the Footman, "and that for
two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are;
secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could
possibly hear you." And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise
going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then
a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.

"How am I to get in?" asked Alice.

"_Are_ you to get in at all?" said the Footman. "That's the first
question, you know."

Alice opened the door and went in. The door led right into a large
kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other; the Duchess
was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the
cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large caldron which seemed to
be full of soup.

"There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!" Alice said to herself,
as well as she could for sneezing. Even the Duchess sneezed
occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a moment's pause. The only two creatures in the
kitchen that did _not_ sneeze were the cook and a large cat, which was
grinning from ear to ear.

"Please would you tell me," said Alice, a little timidly, "why your cat
grins like that?"

"It's a Cheshire-Cat," said the Duchess, "and that's why."

"I didn't know that Cheshire-Cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know
that cats _could_ grin," said Alice.

"You don't know much," said the Duchess, "and that's a fact."

Just then the cook took the caldron of soup off the fire, and at once
set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the
baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,
plates and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them, even when they
hit her, and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite
impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

"Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing!" cried Alice, jumping up and down
in an agony of terror.

"Here! You may nurse it a bit, if you like!" the Duchess said to Alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. "I must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen," and she hurried out of the room.

Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions. "If I
don't take this child away with me," thought Alice, "they're sure to
kill it in a day or two. Wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?" She
said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply.

"If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear," said Alice, "I'll have
nothing more to do with you. Mind now!"

Alice was just beginning to think to herself, "Now, what am I to do with
this creature, when I get it home?" when it grunted again so violently
that Alice looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there
could be _no_ mistake about it--it was neither more nor less than a pig;
so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it
trot away quietly into the wood.

Alice was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire-Cat sitting on a
bough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only grinned when it saw her.
"Cheshire-Puss," began Alice, rather timidly, "would you please tell me
which way I ought to go from here?"

"In _that_ direction," the Cat said, waving the right paw 'round, "lives
a Hatter; and in _that_ direction," waving the other paw, "lives a March
Hare. Visit either you like; they're both mad."

"But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked.

"Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat; "we're all mad here. Do you
play croquet with the Queen to-day?"

"I should like it very much," said Alice, "but I haven't been invited
yet."

"You'll see me there," said the Cat, and vanished.

Alice had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of
the March Hare; it was so large a house that she did not like to go near
till she had nibbled some more of the left-hand bit of mushroom.




VII--A MAD TEA-PARTY


There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it; a Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep.

The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it. "No room! No room!" they cried out when they saw Alice
coming. "There's _plenty_ of room!" said Alice indignantly, and she sat
down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this, but all he said
was "Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"

"I'm glad they've begun asking riddles--I believe I can guess that," she
added aloud.

"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?" said the
March Hare.

"Exactly so," said Alice.

"Then you should say what you mean," the March Hare went on.

"I do," Alice hastily replied; "at least--at least I mean what I
say--that's the same thing, you know."

"You might just as well say," added the Dormouse, which seemed to be
talking in its sleep, "that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing
as 'I sleep when I breathe!'"

"It _is_ the same thing with you," said the Hatter, and he poured a
little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its head impatiently
and said, without opening its eyes, "Of course, of course; just what I
was going to remark myself."

[Illustration]

"Have you guessed the riddle yet?" the Hatter said, turning to Alice
again.

"No, I give it up," Alice replied. "What's the answer?"

"I haven't the slightest idea," said the Hatter.

"Nor I," said the March Hare.

Alice gave a weary sigh. "I think you might do something better with the
time," she said, "than wasting it in asking riddles that have no
answers."

"Take some more tea," the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.

"I've had nothing yet," Alice replied in an offended tone, "so I can't
take more."

"You mean you can't take _less_," said the Hatter; "it's very easy to
take _more_ than nothing."

At this, Alice got up and walked off. The Dormouse fell asleep instantly
and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
looked back once or twice; the last time she saw them, they were
trying to put the Dormouse into the tea-pot.

[Illustration: The Trial of the Knave of Hearts.]

"At any rate, I'll never go _there_ again!" said Alice, as she picked
her way through the wood. "It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in
all my life!" Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees
had a door leading right into it. "That's very curious!" she thought. "I
think I may as well go in at once." And in she went.

Once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little
glass table. Taking the little golden key, she unlocked the door that
led into the garden. Then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she
had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high;
then she walked down the little passage; and _then_--she found herself
at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the
cool fountains.




VIII--THE QUEEN'S CROQUET GROUND


A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden; the roses
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
painting them red. Suddenly their eyes chanced to fall upon Alice, as
she stood watching them. "Would you tell me, please," said Alice, a
little timidly, "why you are painting those roses?"

Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began, in a low
voice, "Why, the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and, if the Queen
was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So
you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to--" At this
moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
out, "The Queen! The Queen!" and the three gardeners instantly threw
themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps
and Alice looked 'round, eager to see the Queen.

First came ten soldiers carrying clubs, with their hands and feet at the
corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
diamonds. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them,
all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and
Queens, and among them Alice recognized the White Rabbit. Then followed
the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a crimson velvet
cushion; and last of all this grand procession came THE KING AND THE
QUEEN OF HEARTS.

When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
at her, and the Queen said severely, "Who is this?" She said it to the
Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.

"My name is Alice, so please Your Majesty," said Alice very politely;
but she added to herself, "Why, they're only a pack of cards, after
all!"

"Can you play croquet?" shouted the Queen. The question was evidently
meant for Alice.

"Yes!" said Alice loudly.

"Come on, then!" roared the Queen.

"It's--it's a very fine day!" said a timid voice to Alice. She was
walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.

"Very," said Alice. "Where's the Duchess?"

"Hush! Hush!" said the Rabbit. "She's under sentence of execution."

"What for?" said Alice.

"She boxed the Queen's ears--" the Rabbit began.

"Get to your places!" shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
other. However, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
began.

Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her
life; it was all ridges and furrows. The croquet balls were live
hedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to double
themselves up and stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

The players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time,
the Queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting,
"Off with his head!" or "Off with her head!" about once in a minute.

"They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here," thought Alice; "the
great wonder is that there's anyone left alive!"

She was looking about for some way of escape, when she noticed a curious
appearance in the air. "It's the Cheshire-Cat," she said to herself;
"now I shall have somebody to talk to."

"How are you getting on?" said the Cat.

"I don't think they play at all fairly," Alice said, in a rather
complaining tone; "and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear
oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular."

"How do you like the Queen?" said the Cat in a low voice.

"Not at all," said Alice.

[Illustration]

Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going
on. So she went off in search of her hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged
in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent
opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other; the only
difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of
the garden, where Alice could see it trying, in a helpless sort of way,
to fly up into a tree. She caught the flamingo and tucked it away under
her arm, that it might not escape again.

Just then Alice ran across the Duchess (who was now out of prison). She
tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's and they walked off together.
Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper. She was a
little startled, however, when she heard the voice of the Duchess close
to her ear. "You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes
you forget to talk."

"The game's going on rather better now," Alice said, by way of keeping
up the conversation a little.

"'Tis so," said the Duchess; "and the moral of that is--'Oh, 'tis love,
'tis love that makes the world go 'round!'"

"Somebody said," Alice whispered, "that it's done by everybody minding
his own business!"

"Ah, well! It means much the same thing," said the Duchess, digging her
sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder, as she added "and the moral of
_that_ is--'Take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of
themselves.'"

To Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's arm that was linked into hers
began to tremble. Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of
them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm!

"Now, I give you fair warning," shouted the Queen, stamping on the
ground as she spoke, "either you or your head must be off, and that in
about half no time. Take your choice!" The Duchess took her choice, and
was gone in a moment.

"Let's go on with the game," the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too
much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
croquet-ground.

All the time they were playing, the Queen never left off quarreling with
the other players and shouting, "Off with his head!" or "Off with her
head!" By the end of half an hour or so, all the players, except the
King, the Queen and Alice, were in custody of the soldiers and under
sentence of execution.

Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and walked away with
Alice.

Alice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally, "You
are all pardoned."

Suddenly the cry "The Trial's beginning!" was heard in the distance, and
Alice ran along with the others.




IX--WHO STOLE THE TARTS?


The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was
standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand
and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court
was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it. "I wish they'd get the
trial done," Alice thought, "and hand 'round the refreshments!"

The judge, by the way, was the King and he wore his crown over his great
wig. "That's the jury-box," thought Alice; "and those twelve creatures
(some were animals and some were birds) I suppose they are the jurors."

Just then the White Rabbit cried out "Silence in the court!"

"Herald, read the accusation!" said the King.

[Illustration]

On this, the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then
unrolled the parchment-scroll and read as follows:

    "The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
      All on a summer day;
    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts
      And took them quite away!"

"Call the first witness," said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three
blasts on the trumpet and called out, "First witness!"

The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand
and a piece of bread and butter in the other.

"You ought to have finished," said the King. "When did you begin?"

The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm in arm with the Dormouse. "Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it
was," he said.

"Give your evidence," said the King, "and don't be nervous, or I'll have
you executed on the spot."

This did not seem to encourage the witness at all; he kept shifting from
one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and, in his
confusion, he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread
and butter.

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation--she was
beginning to grow larger again.

The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went
down on one knee. "I'm a poor man, Your Majesty," he began.

"You're a _very_ poor _speaker_," said the King.

"You may go," said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court.

"Call the next witness!" said the King.

The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in
her hand and the people near the door began sneezing all at once.

"Give your evidence," said the King.

"Sha'n't," said the cook.

The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in a low voice,
"Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness."

"Well, if I must, I must," the King said. "What are tarts made of?"

"Pepper, mostly," said the cook.

For some minutes the whole court was in confusion and by the time they
had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.

"Never mind!" said the King, "call the next witness."

Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list. Imagine her
surprise when he read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the
name "Alice!"




X--ALICE'S EVIDENCE


"Here!" cried Alice. She jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over
the jury-box, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd
below.

"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay.

"The trial cannot proceed," said the King, "until all the jurymen are
back in their proper places--_all_," he repeated with great emphasis,
looking hard at Alice.

"What do you know about this business?" the King said to Alice.

"Nothing whatever," said Alice.

The King then read from his book: "Rule forty-two. _All persons more
than a mile high to leave the court_."

"_I'm_ not a mile high," said Alice.

"Nearly two miles high," said the Queen.

[Illustration]

"Well, I sha'n't go, at any rate," said Alice.

The King turned pale and shut his note-book hastily. "Consider your
verdict," he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

"There's more evidence to come yet, please Your Majesty," said the White
Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry. "This paper has just been picked
up. It seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to--to somebody." He
unfolded the paper as he spoke and added, "It isn't a letter, after all;
it's a set of verses."

"Please, Your Majesty," said the Knave, "I didn't write it and they
can't prove that I did; there's no name signed at the end."

"You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your
name like an honest man," said the King. There was a general clapping of
hands at this.

"Read them," he added, turning to the White Rabbit.

There was dead silence in the court whilst the White Rabbit read out the
verses.

"That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet," said the
King.

"_I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it," ventured Alice.

"If there's no meaning in it," said the King, "that saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. Let the jury consider
their verdict."

"No, no!" said the Queen. "Sentence first--verdict afterwards."

"Stuff and nonsense!" said Alice loudly. "The idea of having the
sentence first!"

"Hold your tongue!" said the Queen, turning purple.

"I won't!" said Alice.

"Off with her head!" the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody
moved.

"Who cares for _you_?" said Alice (she had grown to her full size by
this time). "You're nothing but a pack of cards!"

[Illustration]

At this, the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying down upon
her; she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.

"Wake up, Alice dear!" said her sister. "Why, what a long sleep you've
had!"

"Oh, I've had such a curious dream!" said Alice. And she told her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange adventures
of hers that you have just been reading about. Alice got up and ran off,
thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had
been.
